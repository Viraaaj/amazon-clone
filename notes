2] If using external links for images whitelist those links in next.onfig.js file otherwise it will give an error

4] Creating custom tailwind css classes:
    goto global.css => @layer components{ .classname { @apply styling here} }

5] tailwind css is mobile first so all the styles applied are by default for mobile view
